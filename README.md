* You will need to create a class and implement accessor and mutator methods. The mutator method will not just be a basic update value method and will possibly require topics we have learned in semester one.
* If you clone this entire repo, you can run test to see if your code passes by right-clicking on src->test->java and Run All Test OR you can go into ClockTest.java and right click and run on each method run that test
* Examples
  * Quadratic Equation Information
  * Clock Class
