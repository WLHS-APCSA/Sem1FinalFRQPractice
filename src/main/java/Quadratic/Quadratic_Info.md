# Quadratic Info Class

Write a class that creates a quadratic equation object that represents an equation in the form ax^2+bx+c. 

## Specs
* Default constructor sets a=b=c=1, overloaded constructor allows user to set a,b,c.
* Write getter methods to retrieve a,b,c
* Write setter methods to modify a,b,c
* Write a method that calculates and returns the discriminant
* Write a method that will determine if that equation has real solutions
* Write a method that will find the roots and can handle the real/complex cases. Roots are returned in an array.
